## Keyboard command

### `keyboard_roll_yaw_perching.py`

Start Gazebo in one terminal:

```bash
source ~/ros/jsk_aerial_robot_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch gimbalrotor roll_yaw_perching.launch
```

For hardware, use `roslaunch gimbalrotor roll_yaw_perching.launch simulation:=false`
instead. Hardware uses the configured Spinal serial bridge and OptiTrack; physical
contact must already exist before enabling perching. Gazebo creates an ideal
passive hinge when perching is enabled.

Start the keyboard in a second terminal:

```bash
source ~/ros/jsk_aerial_robot_ws/devel/setup.bash
rosrun gimbalrotor keyboard_roll_yaw_perching.py
```

Tap a paired motion key for a small step (default 0.2 degrees); there are no
numeric destination prompts or per-key planning transactions.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `r`, `t` | Arm, take off |
| `e`, `d` | Enable/capture, disable perching |
| `j`, `l` | Active yaw joint − / + |
| `a`, `f` | Active roll joint − / + |
| `i`, `k` | Passive-hinge alpha + / −, relative to the current lock |
| `z` | Explicit body pitch rezero with measured roll/yaw joints frozen |
| `b` | Final relock after fresh rezero ready/not-active/not-failed feedback |
| Space | Cancel the target producer and hold the applied reference |
| `g`, `h` | Land, HALT motors |
| `s`, `?` | Status, help |
| `q`, Ctrl+C | Request stop, retain contact hold, restore terminal and quit |

Supported setup: **physically perch → e → z → wait PITCH_REZERO_HOLD → b → navigate**.
Enable only captures measured contact; it does not start rezero. Manual motion is
available immediately after a valid lock if no setup operation is pending. Rezero
uses multilink's signed measured-feedback routine, with roll/yaw frozen:
`alpha_dot = command_sign * clamp(kp * wrap(target_pitch - measured_pitch), ±rate_limit)`.
The integrated alpha is bounded by passive travel. Body position and attitude rotate
together about the same captured physical pivot. Readiness requires measured pitch
error and measured pitch rate to remain within tolerance for the stable duration.
ACTIVE and HOLD block ordinary motion. Failures retain the last valid body reference
and frozen active joints, with the cause in diagnostics.

The mounting pipe has approximately pi yaw. At zero active joints, contact/pivot +Y
maps approximately to body −Y, so positive alpha reduces measured world body pitch.
`pitch_rezero_command_sign: -1.0` therefore gives negative feedback, as in multilink;
this sign is applied once to alpha rate, separately from servo polarity. Nonzero
roll/yaw use the actual transformed hinge axis. A local FK response check rejects
a sign/geometry combination that would increase the pitch error; there is no
analytic endpoint solver or Stroke-based rezero controller.

The navigator **inherits the base relock callback**, as multilink does: enabled +
HOVER → reset old setup/targets → capture current measured joints/body → publish a
new base lock identity. It adds no stationary-body, completed-motion, or QP-stage
gate. Invalid measurements reject capture with an explicit reason. General relock
is available on `perching/relock` (`Empty`), including while moving. The keyboard's
`b` is specifically the multilink final-setup operation: it requires fresh rezero
ready=true, active=false, failed=false. On setup failure, use `d` and resolve the
cause before retrying. These keyboard checks are distinct from general navigator
relock policy. Successful relock refreshes every nominal baseline without zeroing
the active servos.

```yaml
navigation:
  roll_yaw_perching:
    qp_planning: false
```

Missing/false selects direct FK. Roll/yaw are URDF joint angles and pitch is the
passive hinge coordinate; positive joint motion can produce negative body rotation.
The keyboard accumulates independent nominal destinations and sends `Float64`
commands under `perching/roll_yaw`: `alpha_target`, `roll_target`, `yaw_target`.
Each callback changes only its own coordinate. Quick `j`, `a`, `i` taps preserve
all three destinations, even before feedback catches up. Navigator `nominal_angles`
reports accepted destinations; `target_angles` reports applied references (both
`Vector3Stamped`, x=roll, y=alpha, z=yaw). Restart/relock read nominal feedback;
rejected/clamped commands reconcile with it. Manual output follows multilink's
bounded nominal → final → FK flow, with zero-rate hold references and no per-key
quintic interpolation, lookahead limit, or endpoint-tracking gate. Joint/tilt limits
and physical contact/feedback checks still apply. Velocity/acceleration trajectory
caps apply to the optional QP producer; rezero uses its configured feedback rate cap.

The existing full-vector `perching/roll_yaw/target` interface remains available for
intentional complete nominal updates, with frame ID
`perching_lock_<base lock timestamp in nanoseconds>`. Ordinary keys use independent
topics so untouched coordinates cannot be overwritten. Space uses
`perching/roll_yaw/cancel` (`UInt64` base lock identity), holds the applied reference,
and never zeros joints or returns to the old lock. Local monotonic receipt time
provides keyboard freshness; multilink itself uses local ROS receipt times. Remote
lock stamps are identities, not clocks to subtract. Navigator command callbacks
validate current onboard feedback without comparing laptop command timestamps;
onboard estimator/joint source-time checks remain intact.

With `qp_planning: true`, explicit `prepare`, `align`, `start`, `pause`, `resume`,
and `cancel` topics under `perching/roll_yaw` accept the current `UInt64` session.
`navigation/roll_yaw_perching/request` specifies the existing lock-relative **body**
orientation request in radians. This optional planner feeds the same FK/output
path. Manual key meanings do not change. A manual input invalidates the optional
producer and updates the requested nominal coordinate immediately, preserving the
other destinations. No QP state or per-key transaction gates manual navigation. Failed plans hold with a reason and never fall back to another
motion. QP-only settings cannot invalidate ordinary FK capture/navigation.

The common hooks are base enable/disable/relock/reset and measured lock identity, the shared
recursive state lock, `applyManualPitchDelta`, and the base update's virtual
`applyActivePerchingTarget`. Roll–yaw retains its own passive-hinge FK, articulated
CoG conversion and named active-joint output. The optional QP executor exists only
for an explicit planning request; ordinary navigation owns its nominal/final
targets independently. Rezero ports multilink's trigger, feedback update, frozen-joint
checks, ready/failed HOLD and final-relock keyboard workflow.
The legacy pitch topic and pitch-only `uav/nav` position command mean absolute
lock-relative alpha; independent translations/body roll/yaw are rejected while
perched. Normal, multilink and pitch-only implementations and key mappings are
unchanged, including pitch-only servo set/freeze/unfreeze and unperch/release.
No passive actuator or saw command is published.

Validation for this revision: catkin package build and offline FK/QP/keyboard
checks. These do not establish simulated or hardware flight performance; earlier
large-destination keyboard flight results do not validate this revised workflow.

## Multilink passive-pivot pitch rezero

`keyboard_command/keyboard_perching_secondary.py` and
`tasks/auto_multilink_perching_pitch_experiment.py` use the multilink navigator
with the normal `gimbalrotor_controller`. The active mechanism stays exactly
`joint_pitch` plus one yaw/roll joint. The passive hinge is external to URDF/KDL.

Calibrate `pitch_rezero_pivot_offset_{x,y,z}` in
`config/beetle/MultilinkPerching.yaml` from CAD/measurement: the default assumes
that `yaw_hand_link` origin is the physical hinge center. The axis is also in
that contact-link frame (default +Y). At the trigger, the measured BASELINK pose
and measured mechanism FK give `T_W_C = T_W_B * T_B_C`. The navigator stores
`P = T_W_C * offset` and `a = normalize(R_W_C * axis)`. During rezero it commands
`R_d = Rot(a, alpha) * R_0` and `p_d = P + Rot(a, alpha) * (p_0 - P)`, keeping
both active joints and the body-to-CoG vector frozen. The ordinary fixed-contact
cutting relation `T_W_B = locked_contact_world * inverse(T_B_C(q))` resumes only
after reset/relock. Relocking is a software assumption of fixed contact; it does
not mechanically secure the passive hinge.

The rate-limited outer loop uses measured BASELINK world pitch. Configure
`pitch_rezero_command_sign` for the actual direction of pitch response. An
arbitrary hinge orientation may make zero pitch unreachable within the allowed
30-degree travel; this results in a timeout hold. Successful stabilization needs
pitch error within 2 degrees and pitch rate within 0.05 rad/s continuously for
0.30 seconds. Both success and failure hold the last valid body target with the
active joints frozen. Failure never returns to the old tilted lock automatically.
Disable/retry safely after failure. A feedback gap over 0.1 s breaks stabilization;
a clock reversal or gap over 0.5 s fails the maneuver. Invalid configuration
(non-finite/range-invalid values, zero axis/sign, timeout shorter than dwell)
disables the rezero subscriber. Invalid/stale joint diagnostics and unavailable
pitch-rate estimates are published as NaN.

During ACTIVE and HOLD (ready or failed), measured active pitch and secondary
joint positions are checked against their values captured at rezero start using
wrapped angular errors. `pitch_rezero_pitch_joint_hold_tolerance` and
`pitch_rezero_secondary_joint_hold_tolerance` each default to `0.02` rad (about
1.15 degrees) and must be finite and in `(0, 0.5]` rad. Exceeding either tolerance
invalidates the passive-pivot-only motion assumption and enters failure HOLD;
stale/unavailable mechanism feedback also fails and publishes both hold errors
as NaN. Failure clears READY, stops further passive rotation commands, and keeps
commanding the original frozen joints and last valid body target. Monitoring
continues until reset/relock. The scripts check READY/FAILED before relocking;
the raw `/perching/relock` callback retains its existing reset behavior and does
not enforce these flags.

Manual keyboard:

```bash
rosrun gimbalrotor keyboard_perching_secondary.py
```

Physically perch first. Press `e` for a fresh provisional lock, `z` for whole-body
rezero, `s` to check ready, and `r` for a fresh final lock. Then `j/l` decreases/
increases the secondary joint, `i/k` increases/decreases the logical cutting
pitch delta, and Space returns both joints to the final locked configuration.
`d` disables perching, `h` shows help, and Ctrl-C exits without changing robot
state. Motion is blocked during pending rezero, ACTIVE, and either HOLD outcome.
Secondary commands use physical joint coordinates divided by the configured
secondary sign; pitch diagnostics account for the configured pitch sign.
Both scripts wait for lock timestamps strictly newer than their request and for
subsequent nominal feedback. They publish enable and relock only once per request.

Equivalent topic sequence (default robot namespace):

```bash
# Physically perch, then provisionally lock.
rostopic pub -1 /gimbalrotor/perching/enable std_msgs/Bool 'data: true'
rostopic pub -1 /gimbalrotor/perching/multilink/pitch_rezero std_msgs/Empty '{}'
# Wait for true; check failed is false before relocking.
rostopic echo /gimbalrotor/perching/multilink/pitch_rezero_ready
rostopic pub -1 /gimbalrotor/perching/relock std_msgs/Empty '{}'
# After the fresh final lock, use the existing secondary/pitch command topics.
# Example zero logical pitch delta (returns pitch to final lock):
rostopic pub -1 /gimbalrotor/perching/manual_pitch_delta std_msgs/Float64 'data: 0.0'
# Secondary target is an absolute joint command in radians, divided by its sign:
# rostopic pub -1 /gimbalrotor/perching/multilink/secondary_joint_target std_msgs/Float64 'data: <target>'
rostopic pub -1 /gimbalrotor/perching/enable std_msgs/Bool 'data: false'
```

Automatic experiment (run only after physically perching in HOVER):

```bash
rosrun gimbalrotor auto_multilink_perching_pitch_experiment.py \
  _perform_pitch_rezero:=true _step_deg:=0.8 _hold_time:=15.0 _number_of_steps:=15
```

Default sequence: enable → fresh provisional lock → rezero → ready → relock →
fresh final lock → secondary settled → active cutting pitch steps. Rezero
failure or missing fresh feedback aborts without cutting. Failure after rezero
starts leaves the navigator holding; it does not silently disable or relock.
`~perform_pitch_rezero:=false` skips rezero/relock and uses the initial lock.
Other defaults are `~direction:=1`, `~max_delta_deg:=20`,
`~return_to_lock_at_end:=false`, `~disable_perching_at_end:=false`,
`~lock_timeout:=3.0`, `~rezero_timeout:=8.0`,
`~secondary_settle_timeout:=3.0`, `~target_update_timeout:=1.0`, and
`~feedback_timeout:=0.5`. The keyboard lock timeout defaults to 2.0 s. Both
scripts support `~robot_namespace` (default `/gimbalrotor`). Wait deadlines use
wall time so paused ROS time cannot hang a lock or ready wait.

`target_body_pose` continues to describe the desired BASELINK pose in both phases.
All new navigator defaults are documented in `MultilinkPerching.yaml`.
